  This playlist is specifically formatted for use with TiviMate. To use it, simply load the URL provided in this repository into Tivimate as an "M3U Playlist." No additional setup is needed as Tivimate handles the required headers for playback.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Choose the playlist format that suits your application or media player.

3. Ensure that your application supports the required settings, such as setting the `Referer` header for streams to play.

## Playlist and EPG Syncing:

The playlist and EPG data are updated every 4 hours. Since streaming data can change frequently, itâ€™s recommended to sync the refresh of both your playlist and guide information simultaneously in your IPTV application. If you notice 'No information' being displayed in the guide, try manually refreshing the EPG within your application to ensure the most up-to-date data is loaded.
